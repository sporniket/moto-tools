## 1. What is **Sporniket's MO/TO tools**, and when to use it ?

**Sporniket's MO/TO tools** is a python library with a set of command line interfaces that will assist a developper of software running on emulators of the family of computers made by Thomson during the 1980s, models "MO" and models "TO".

The current list of tools : 

* Tools for basic language
  * `moto_nl` : number the lines of a basic source that have line unnumbered ; the command line interface is designed after the command `nl`.
  * `moto_prettier` : consistently format the provided utf-8 encoded basic source file
  * `moto_bas2lst` : convert tokenized or ASCII basic program into an utf-8 encoded basic source file
  * `moto_lst2bas` : convert an utf-8 encoded source file into tokenized or ASCII basic program
* Tools for manipulating media images (tape, floppy disks) for emulation and exchange
  * `moto_tar` : list, create or extract `*.k7` tape images ; the command line interface is designed after the command `tar` (_Tape ARchives_)
  * `moto_sdar` : list, create or extract `*.sd` SDDrive disk images (a.k.a. _SD ARchives_) ; the command line interface is also designed after the command `tar`

#### v0.0.1

The target platform is Thomson MO5. 

Provides the following tools :

* `moto_tar` : create, list or extract files to or from a tape archive format ; the command line interface is designed after the command `tar`.
